## Background

The term Data Science is very generic and a job role can be very different with the same title, data science. Data science can be broken down into 3 roles: Data engineer, Data analyst, ML engineer. The problem with a lot of job posting websites is that the particular data science role you are looking for is filled with the noise of other roles.

## Project Goal

To create a job recommendation system specifically for Data science, to increase the number of job applied for, that match what you are interested in.

## Purpose

The job recommendations from websites (e.g Linkedin) aren't tailored specifically for you and often times recommend jobs with other roles.

### Initial data
Inital project development will be based on the data scraped from:

- [Dataset 1](https://www.kaggle.com/jobspikr/data-scientist-job-postings-from-the-usa)
- [Dataset 2](https://www.kaggle.com/rashikrahmanpritom/data-science-job-posting-on-glassdoor)
- [Dataset 3](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/data-scientist-jobs)

Eventually data will be scraped myself, to added to the pipeline

# Tasks
1. Explore datasets to combine in single large dataset
